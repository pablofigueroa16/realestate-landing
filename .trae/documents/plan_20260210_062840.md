I will recreate the "Bali Real Estate" landing page in your Next.js application. Since the target site is a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) and I cannot scrape the exact rendered text, I will build a high-fidelity replica using a professional "Bali Luxury Real Estate" theme with the following structure:

### 1. Setup & Dependencies
-   **Icons**: Install `lucide-react` for modern UI icons.
-   **Images**: Use high-quality Unsplash placeholder images representing Bali villas.
-   **Styling**: Use your existing Tailwind CSS setup.

### 2. Create UI Components
I will create a modular component structure in `src/components`:
-   **Navbar**: Responsive navigation with a transparent-to-solid scroll effect.
-   **Hero Section**: Full-screen background image, headline ("Find Your Dream Paradise in Bali"), and a property search bar.
-   **Featured Properties**: A grid showcasing luxury villas with details (Price, Beds, Baths, Location).
-   **Why Choose Bali**: An informational section highlighting investment potential and lifestyle.
-   **Contact Form**: A clean lead generation form for inquiries.
-   **Footer**: Standard footer with links and social icons.

### 3. Implementation Steps
1.  **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install lucide-react`.
2.  **Create Components**: Build the components listed above in `src/components/`.
3.  **Assemble Page**: Update `src/app/page.tsx` to compose these components into a seamless landing page.
4.  **Update Layout**: Ensure `src/app/layout.tsx` and `src/app/globals.css` support the new design (fonts, colors).

This will result in a fully functional, responsive, and visually stunning Real Estate landing page tailored to the "Bali" aesthetic.
