I will transform `src/components/LocationSection.tsx` into a project carousel as requested.

1.  **Dependencies**: Import `useState` for carousel state management, and `ChevronLeft`, `ChevronRight` from `lucide-react` for navigation controls.
2.  **Data Structure**: Create an array of project objects, each containing:
    *   `area`: The location/area label.
    *   `title`: The main project title.
    *   `description`: The project description.
    *   `distances`: An array of strings for the distance list items.
    *   `marketInsight`: The market insight text.
    *   `image`: The background image path.
3.  **Carousel Logic**: Implement state `currentIndex`, `nextProject`, and `prevProject` functions to cycle through the projects.
4.  **UI Updates**:
    *   Wrap the content in the carousel logic.
    *   Add navigation buttons (Left/Right arrows) to allow the user to switch between projects.
    *   Replace static content with dynamic content from the current project in the state.
    *   Map the `distances` array to render the list items dynamically (removing the hardcoded "minutes" circle logic if the new content is just text bullets, or adapting it if it fits). Based on the user's input `"- 01 min Dubai Water Canal Boardwalk"`, I will adapt the list rendering to handle simple text strings with bullets, or try to parse the time if possible. Given the variety of formats ("01 min...", "Acceso directo...", "Frente al mar..."), I will render them as a list with a generic bullet/icon instead of the "time circle" to accommodate all formats flexibly.
5.  **Content Population**: Populate the projects array with the 6 specific projects provided by the user (One River Point, Costa Mare, Mercer House, Sobha Central, Sobha Hartland II, Azizi Milan) with their respective details and image paths.

I will verify the image paths match the ones provided in the prompt.
