I will implement a seamless infinite logo carousel in `src/components/DevelopersSection.tsx` to display the developer logos.

1. **Dependencies & Setup**:

   * I will use `framer-motion` (assuming it's available or use standard CSS animations if not) or standard CSS/React for a smooth infinite scroll effect, which is standard for "logo walls". Given the requirement for "autoplay" and "navigation", a standard carousel might be intended, but for *partner logos*, an infinite marquee is often more "minimalist" and effective. However, the user explicitly asked for "navigation buttons", "indicators", and "autoplay with pause on hover". So I will build a **standard carousel** as requested.

   * I will use `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` for the carousel logic.

   * I will import `ChevronLeft`, `ChevronRight` from `lucide-react`.

2. **Image Data**:

   * I will create an array of image paths corresponding to the files found in `public/developer`: `developer1.png` through `developer10.png`.

3. **Component Implementation**:

   * **Layout**: Inside the existing container, below the title.

   * **Carousel Container**: A relative container with hidden overflow.

   * **Track**: A flex container that shifts based on the current index.

   * **Responsiveness**: Show multiple logos at once (e.g., 2 on mobile, 3 on tablet, 4-5 on desktop) to make it look like a "strip" of alliances, or just one large hero image if they were hero banners. *Self-correction*: These are "developer" logos/images. Usually, these are displayed as a grid or a multi-item carousel. The prompt asks for a "carrusel de imágenes completo". I will assume a multi-item carousel (showing \~3-4 logos at a time) is best for "alliances", but if the images are large banners, I'd show one. Given the filenames (`developerX.png`), they
