I will modify `src/components/WhyChooseSection.tsx` to implement the requested video behavior:

1.  **State Management**: Import `useState` and `useRef` to manage the video playback state.
2.  **Video Configuration**:
    *   Remove `autoPlay`, `loop`, and `muted` attributes to allow sound and manual control.
    *   Add a `ref` to control playback programmatically.
    *   Add an `onEnded` handler to reset the `isPlaying` state when the video finishes.
3.  **Play Button UI**:
    *   Re-introduce the Play button overlay (styled like a YouTube play button or similar prominent icon) using `lucide-react`.
    *   Make the button visible only when the video is not playing.
4.  **Interaction Logic**:
    *   Implement a `handlePlay` function that plays the video and hides the button when clicked.
    *   Ensure the video plays with sound enabled.

This will allow the user to click the icon to start the video with audio, playing it once through.
