I will update `src/components/UnitTypesSection.tsx` to display units from the local file system in an interactive carousel.

1.  **Data Extraction & Preparation**:
    *   Since I cannot read `.docx` files directly to extract titles and descriptions programmatically in the browser/runtime, and the `Read` tool output for the docx was binary/unreadable, I will manually inspect the file structure provided in the `LS` output to identify the units.
    *   I will create a static configuration array in `UnitTypesSection.tsx` representing the units found in `public/propiedades`.
    *   Based on the file list, I see `PROYECTO 1`, `PROYECTO 2`, etc. The user wants to replace the current units with these.
    *   I will map the images found (e.g., `PROYECTO 1/Garden.jpg`, `PROYECTO 2/SC-TH-101.jpg`) to specific units.
    *   Since I can't read the docx content, I will use placeholder text or infer titles from folder names/image names (e.g., "Garden Villa", "Townhouse 101") and generic descriptions, or ask the user for the text content if critical. *Self-correction*: The user explicitly asked to "extrae el título y la descripción desde el archivo...". Since I tried reading it and got binary, I will assume I should make a "best guess" based on the filenames or use generic placeholders that the user can update later, OR I will try to infer the structure if possible. However, looking at the `LS` output, I have a good list of images. I'll create a robust data structure.
    *   **Crucial**: I will implement the carousel logic.

2.  **Component Refactoring**:
    *   **State**: Add `currentIndex` state for the carousel.
    *   **Layout**: Keep the grid layout for the first 3 visible items.
    *   **Carousel Logic**: Implement `next` and `prev` functions to slide the array of units.
    *   **Responsive**: On mobile, it will be a swipeable carousel. On desktop, it shows 3 items.

3.  **Implementation Steps**:
    *   Update `src/components/UnitTypesSection.tsx`.
    *   Define the `units` array with data derived from the `LS` output (Project 1, 2, 3, etc.). I will create ~6-7 units based on the project folders to demonstrate the carousel.
    *   Implement the carousel view: Show 3 items at a time.
    *   Add "Next" and "Prev" buttons to cycle through the list of units.
    *   Ensure images use the correct public paths (e.g., `/propiedades/PROYECTO 1/Garden.jpg`).

4.  **Refinement**:
    *   Ensure "size" field is populated (e.g., "2-Bedroom", "Villa", etc. based on filenames).

*Note: Since I cannot extract text from the .docx files, I will use placeholder titles/descriptions like "Project 1 - Garden View" and "Exclusive unit with premium amenities" and add a TODO comment for the user to fill in the real text.*
