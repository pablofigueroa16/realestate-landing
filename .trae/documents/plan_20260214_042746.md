I will enhance `src/components/UnitTypesSection.tsx` to implement a robust, nested carousel system.

1. **Data Structure**: I will create a static configuration that maps each project (PROYECTO 1-7) to its list of images found in the file system. Since I cannot dynamically scan folders at runtime in a client component without an API route or static generation script, I will hardcode the arrays of images based on the provided `LS` output. This ensures all images from `PROYECTO1` through `PROYECTO7` are included.

2. **Component Architecture**:

   * **Main Carousel**: The existing carousel that slides through *Projects* (Unit Types) remains.

   * **Nested Carousel**: Inside each Project card, I will replace the single `img` tag with a new `ImageCarousel` component.

   * **`ImageCarousel`** **Component**:

     * Accepts an array of image paths.

     * Has internal state for `currentImageIndex`.

     * Renders the current image with "lazy" loading.

     * Includes overlay navigation arrows (left/right) that appear on hover.

     * Includes dot indicators at the bottom of the image area.

     * Supports touch swipe for mobile.

3. **Implementation Details**:

   * **Arrays**: I'll generate the full list of images for each project from the `LS` data provided in the context.

   * **Responsiveness**: The nested carousel will fit within the card's image container (`h-64`), ensuring it works on all screen sizes.

   * **Navigation**:

     * Main carousel (Projects): Controlled by the top-right arrows.

     * Nested carousel (Images): Controlled by arrows inside the image area. I will ensure event propagation is handled so clicking the image arrows doesn't trigger the card's click (if any).

4. **Refinement**:

   * Update the `units` array to include an `images: string[]` property instead of a single `image` string.

   * The `size`, `title`, `description` fields will remain as they are.

This approach satisfies the requirement to "show all corresponding images for each unit" in an interactive way.
