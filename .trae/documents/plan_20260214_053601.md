I will replace all `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image />` component in `src/components/UnitTypesSection.tsx`.

1.  **Import**: Add `import Image from "next/image";` to `src/components/UnitTypesSection.tsx`.
2.  **Replace Tags**:
    *   Find the `<img>` tag inside `ProjectImageCarousel`.
    *   Replace it with `<Image />`.
    *   Set `src={img}` and `alt={alt}`.
    *   Use `fill` prop because the parent container has `relative` positioning and specific dimensions (`h-64`).
    *   Set `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"` to optimize loading for different viewports.
    *   Keep `className` for styling (`object-cover`, etc.).
    *   Remove `loading="lazy"` as Next.js handles this automatically.
3.  **Config Check**: Since the images are local (starting with `/`), no changes to `next.config.js` `images.domains` are needed.
4.  **Error Handling**: I won't add complex error boundaries for images in this step unless requested, as Next.js Image handles failures gracefully by default (or I can add a placeholder logic if needed, but the prompt asks for "manejo de errores", so I might add a simple `onError` state if I were building a robust component, but standard Next.js Image usage is usually sufficient for local files. I'll stick to standard implementation first). *Self-correction*: The prompt explicitly asks "Implementa manejo de errores...". I will add a simple state to show a fallback if an image fails to load.

This improves performance via automatic resizing, lazy loading, and format optimization (WebP/AVIF).
