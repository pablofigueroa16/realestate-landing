I will fix the Badge positioning issue in `src/components/UnitTypesSection.tsx`.

1.  **Issue**: The "Badge" (`div` with `unit.size`) is currently a sibling of `ProjectImageCarousel` inside the card container. The `absolute` positioning (`top-8 right-8`) might be relative to the card (`relative` likely missing on card or intended to be relative to the image carousel). If it's outside the carousel, it might be overlapping content or hidden behind the carousel if z-index isn't managed, or simply positioned relative to the card which is fine, but the user says it needs to be "correctly above on the right edge of the image carousel".

2.  **Solution**: Move the Badge **inside** the `ProjectImageCarousel` component. This ensures it is always positioned relative to the image container (`relative h-64 ...`), staying consistently in the top-right corner of the image area regardless of card padding or layout shifts.

3.  **Implementation**:
    *   Modify `ProjectImageCarousel` props to accept `badgeText` (string).
    *   Inside `ProjectImageCarousel`, render the Badge `div` (absolute top-4 right-4 z-20).
    *   Remove the Badge `div` from the parent `UnitTypesSection` map loop.
    *   Pass `unit.size` as the `badgeText` prop to `ProjectImageCarousel`.

This creates a self-contained image component with its own overlay elements (navigation + badge).
