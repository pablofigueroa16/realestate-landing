I will fix the Badge positioning issue in `src/components/UnitTypesSection.tsx`.

1.  **Analyze Current State**: The previous `SearchReplace` operations were intended to move the Badge inside `ProjectImageCarousel` and remove it from the parent loop.
    *   Looking at the `Read` output (lines 297-299):
        ```javascript
        {/* Nested Image Carousel */}
        <ProjectImageCarousel images={unit.images} alt={unit.alt} />
        ```
    *   The `badgeText` prop is **missing** in the `ProjectImageCarousel` call!
    *   The Badge div was removed from the parent, but the prop wasn't added correctly in the final file state (likely due to overlapping search/replace contexts or a tool failure I didn't catch in the diff).
    *   Looking at `ProjectImageCarousel` definition (line 8): `function ProjectImageCarousel({ images, alt }: { images: string[]; alt: string })`. It **does not** accept `badgeText`.
    *   Looking at lines 58-60 (inside `ProjectImageCarousel`), there is NO Badge code.

    It seems the previous `SearchReplace` calls failed to apply all changes correctly, or I misread the success. The `Read` output shows the code **without** the badge inside the carousel.

2.  **Plan**:
    *   Update `ProjectImageCarousel` definition to accept `badgeText`.
    *   Add the Badge JSX inside `ProjectImageCarousel`.
    *   Update the usage of `<ProjectImageCarousel />` in the main loop to pass `badgeText={unit.size}`.

This will effectively "redo" the previous attempt that didn't stick.
