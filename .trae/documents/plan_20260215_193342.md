I will modify the `ProjectImageCarousel` component in `src/components/UnitTypesSection.tsx` to handle large images (like the ~10MB ones mentioned) more robustly.

**Specific Implementation:**
1.  **Enhance Error Handling**: I will introduce a new state `unoptimizedImages` to track images that fail to load via the default Next.js optimization pipeline.
2.  **Fallback Logic**: Update the `handleImageError` function to:
    *   First, attempt to load the image with `unoptimized={true}`. This bypasses the Next.js image optimizer (which likely times out on 10MB files) and loads the original S3 image directly.
    *   If it fails again (even unoptimized), then show the "Image not found" placeholder.
3.  **Apply to Carousel**: Pass the `unoptimized={unoptimizedImages[img]}` prop to the `<Image />` component.

This approach automatically solves the issue for the large "PROYECTO 1" images without hardcoding specific URLs, ensuring future large images also work seamlessly.
